            <p>Hi, I'm Dan. I spent much of my life until recently living reactively and with a fixed mindset, but was unexpectedly shaken to life last year by the death of my father. Though a terrible loss, it helped me realize the importance of living life with purpose and self love.  It sounds cheesy as hell, but through self-love I have found myself freed from the bondage of my own self doubts and discovering new strengths and capabilities on an almost daily basis. I want to connect with purposeful people and companies, and to help one another grow.</p>
